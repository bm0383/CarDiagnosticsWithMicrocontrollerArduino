# CarDiagnosticsWithMicrocontrollerArduino

Since 2001 in Europe cars use OBD2 protocol, which is standard for all automotive manufacturers. 
The protocol was designed in 1969 and introduced in 1980. 
At that time, it only allowed the mechanics to read the statuses of various subsystems in the car. 
Since then, its use increased to such extent that today we can show different parameters of a car in real time,
read the recorded errors, as well as delete and modify them. Many of these parameters can be shown on the trip computer,
but not in older cars. The aim of this thesis is to use the Arduino microcontroller and OBD2 interface and use them to read 
and save the car’s parameters. The final product will be installed in a car.

The parameters that are shown:
- Speed
- RPM
- MAF air ﬂow rate
- Calculated engine load 
- Intake manifold absolute pressure 
- Engine consumption
- ...
